## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

The required final project materials can be found as follows: 

- ![Jupyter notebook](./Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb)
- ![HTML](./Traffic_Sign_Classifier.html)
- ![writeup](./writeup.md)

To run everything from the notebook, outside all of the python dependencies it assumes that the traffic sign data provided by Udacity is saved into `traffic-signs-data`. Everything else should be self contained.
